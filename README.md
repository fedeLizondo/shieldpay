# Challenge ShieldPay

## Description
This project is a challenge for ShieldPay. It involves creating a web application that demonstrates proficiency in modern web development practices. 
The application should be built using Node.js and Docker, and it should include features such as user authentication, data persistence. 
The goal is to showcase the ability to build a scalable and maintainable application from scratch.

To ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase, we will use DDD (Domain-Driven Design) along with a hexagonal architecture. 
These methodologies will help us separate concerns, improve testability, and align the development process with the business domain.
